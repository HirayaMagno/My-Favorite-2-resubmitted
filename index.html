        <p> My Favorite thing to do is biking. I like biking around my neighborhood with my family. I do it in my free time. Biking is an enjoyable thing when it is sunny and quiet outside. I learned to bike when I was around 4 years old. I started biking without training wheels when I was 6 years old. I was happy when I biked without training wheels. I also like biking because it keeps me so occupied. This why I so very much like to bike.
